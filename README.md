## Getting Started

To run the project locally clone the repo to your machine. Run `npm install`.

You'll need to update the PG config in `server/modules/todo.js` to point to your own local Postgres DB and create a table using the `CREATE TABLE` query in `todo_create_database.sql`.

Once your local database is setup and running you can run `npm start` and view the app running on `localhost:5000`.
